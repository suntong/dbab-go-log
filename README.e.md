## {{.Name}} - Pixel Server dbab-svr in Go


# Download binaries

- The latest binary executables are available under  
https://github.com/suntong/{{.Name}}/releases  
as the result of the Continuous-Integration process.
- I.e., they are built right from the source code during every git tagging commit automatically by [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/).
- Pick & choose the binary executable that suits your OS and its architecture. E.g., for Linux, it would most probably be the `{{.Name}}_linux_VER_amd64` file. If your OS and its architecture is not available in the download list, please let me know and I'll add it.
- You may want to rename it to a shorter name instead, e.g., `{{.Name}}`, after downloading it. 


# Debian package

Will be available next.

# Install Source

To install the source code instead:

go get github.com/suntong/{{.Name}}
